This is a keyboard that provides dead keys for strokes and makes available tilde under alt-gr + "ù" and backtick under altgr + "0", mute keys are under control + ' for acute stroke and control + 0 for grave stroke. Dead keys are useful to make uppercase stroked letters like À (control + 0, then A).

I also added some symbols under alt-gr+letters for greek letters αβ©δ€φγ, quote marks «» under altgr + "," and "." ± under altgr + "-"
